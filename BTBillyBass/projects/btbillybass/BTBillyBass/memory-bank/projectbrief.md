# Project Brief: BTBillyBass

## Purpose

To create a modern, Arduino-based recreation of the iconic Big Mouth Billy Bass, incorporating contemporary features and customization options while maintaining the nostalgic appeal of the original animatronic singing fish.

## Core Requirements

- Arduino-based control system for fish movements and audio
- Servo motor control for mouth and body movements
- Audio playback capability
- Motion sensor integration for interactive responses
- Customizable song library
- Reliable and smooth mechanical operation

## Success Criteria

- Smooth, synchronized movement of fish components with audio
- Reliable motion detection and response
- Clear, quality audio playback
- Easy song/motion sequence customization
- Durable mechanical assembly
- User-friendly control interface

## Constraints

- Arduino hardware limitations
- Power supply requirements
- Physical space constraints within fish housing
- Mechanical durability requirements
- Audio quality limitations of small speakers

## Stakeholders

- Project Developer: Primary developer and maintainer
- End Users: Hobbyists and enthusiasts looking to build their own BTBillyBass
- Open Source Community: Potential contributors and users of the project
