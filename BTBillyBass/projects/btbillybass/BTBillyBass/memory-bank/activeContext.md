# Active Context: Billy Bass Control System

## Current Focus

Implementing simplified motor control with direct calibration system and improved command interface.

## Recent Changes

- Removed all safety check systems for simpler operation
- Fixed command conflict between manual mode and mouth speed settings
- Changed manual mode toggle from 'm' to 'l'
- Simplified motor control logic
- Updated command menu and help system

## Next Steps

1. Test basic movements with new control system:
   - Open/close mouth with 'o'/'c'
   - Flap tail with 'f'
   - Move body with 'b'
   - Reset with 'r'

2. Verify calibration commands:
   - 't' for mouth timing
   - 'y' for body timing
   - 'm' for mouth speed
   - 'n' for body speed
   - 'p' to print settings

3. Test mode toggles:
   - 'l' for manual/auto mode
   - 'a' for audio reactivity
   - 'd' for debug output

## Active Decisions

- **Safety System**: Removed in favor of calibration
  - Status: Completed
  - Context: Simplified control for better reliability

- **Command Interface**: Updated to avoid conflicts
  - Status: Completed
  - Context: 'l' now used for manual mode, 'm' for mouth speed

- **Motor Control**: Direct control with calibration
  - Status: Active
  - Context: Using timing and speed settings instead of safety checks

## Open Questions

- What are the optimal timing values for smooth operation?
- What speed settings provide the best movement control?
- How responsive is the audio reaction with new control system?

## Current Configuration

```cpp
// Movement Timing
mouthOpenTime = 400ms    // Default mouth open duration
mouthCloseTime = 400ms   // Default mouth close duration
bodyForwardTime = 600ms  // Default body forward time
bodyBackTime = 600ms     // Default body return time

// Speed Settings
mouthSpeed = 150         // Default mouth motor speed
bodySpeed = 120         // Default body motor speed

// Movement Limits
MAX_MOVEMENT_TIME = 1000ms
MAX_SPEED = 180
```

## Testing Process

1. Basic Movement Testing:
   ```
   o -> c  : Test mouth movement
   f -> b  : Test body movement
   r      : Verify reset function
   ```

2. Calibration Process:
   ```
   p      : Check current settings
   t      : Adjust mouth timing
   y      : Adjust body timing
   m      : Set mouth speed
   n      : Set body speed
   ```

3. Mode Testing:
   ```
   l      : Toggle manual/auto
   a      : Toggle audio reaction
   d      : Toggle debug output
   ```

## Known Issues

- Previous safety checks have been removed
- Timing values may need adjustment
- Speed settings need verification

## Immediate Tasks

1. Test basic movements
2. Verify calibration commands
3. Document optimal settings
4. Test audio reactivity
5. Update documentation
