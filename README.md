# HeliosBillyBass

Consolidated Arduino animatronics workspace with full history preserved (via git subtree).

## Structure
- firmware/helios: Helios project (docs, mkdocs, examples)
  - examples/BTBillyBass: example sketch and libs
- firmware/btb: BTBillyBass project (original structure preserved)

Each subproject keeps its own docs and assets within its folder.

## Development
- Work inside the subfolders under `firmware/`
- Open the `.ino` projects in Arduino IDE or your preferred environment

## Origin
This monorepo consolidates the previous repositories after history-preserving merge.
