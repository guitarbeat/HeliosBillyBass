# HeliosBillyBass

Combined Arduino animatronics workspace with full history preserved (via git subtree), now organized with clearer names.

## Structure
- firmware/helios: Former `HeliosBillyBass` project
- firmware/btb: Former `BTBillyBass` project

Each subproject keeps its own docs and assets within its folder. See their respective READMEs for setup and usage.

## Development
- Work inside the subfolders under `firmware/`
- Open the `.ino` projects in Arduino IDE, or your preferred environment

## Origin
This monorepo consolidates the previous repositories after history-preserving merge.
