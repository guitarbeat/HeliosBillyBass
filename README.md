# Monorepo

This repository is being prepared as a multi-project monorepo.

## Structure
- projects/
  - btbillybass/
    - BTBillyBass/  (Arduino Big Mouth Billy Bass controller)

## Next steps
- Add the second project under `projects/<name>/`
- Consider a shared `docs/` or `tools/` at repo root for cross-project content
- Add CI that scopes by project path

See `projects/btbillybass/BTBillyBass/README.md` for the fish project docs.
