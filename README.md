# HeliosBillyBass

Consolidated Arduino animatronics workspace with full history preserved (via git subtree).

## Structure
- firmware/projects/billybass_v2: fresh attempt at fish control
- firmware/projects/archive/btbillybass: archived working prototype
- firmware/projects/helios: Helios docs, mkdocs site, and examples

Each subproject keeps its own docs and assets within its folder.

## Development
- Work inside the subfolders under `firmware/`
- Open the `.ino` projects in Arduino IDE or your preferred environment

## Origin
This monorepo consolidates the previous repositories after history-preserving merge.
