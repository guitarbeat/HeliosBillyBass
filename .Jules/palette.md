## 2025-10-25 - [Accessibility Improvements]
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons using `title` attribute for tooltips are insufficient for screen readers; explicit `aria-label` is required. Material Icons should be hidden from screen readers using `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent reading ligature text.
**Action:** Always pair icon-only buttons with `aria-label` and hide decorative icons. Ensure custom macros enforce these patterns.

## 2025-10-26 - [Form Tooltip Pattern]
**Learning:** Legacy help buttons were nested inside `<label>` elements, creating invalid HTML and accessibility issues.
**Action:** Refactored to use a side-by-side flex pattern where the help button is a sibling of the label. Updated `toggleTooltip` JS to support finding the tooltip container from this new structure. Use `label_with_help` macro to enforce this valid pattern.

## 2025-10-27 - [Accessible Collapsible Sections]
**Learning:** Collapsible sections used non-semantic `<h3>` elements as click targets, making them inaccessible to keyboard users and screen readers.
**Action:** Refactored `section_card` macro to use a semantic `<button>` inside the header with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes. Updated JavaScript to toggle ARIA states and handle the new structure while maintaining backward compatibility.

## 2025-10-28 - [Dynamic Icon Button Accessibility]
**Learning:** Buttons generated dynamically via JavaScript (e.g., service controls, wake-up list) often lack accessible names when they rely on `title` or hidden text spans. Material Icons' ligature text (e.g., "play_arrow") can be read aloud by screen readers if not hidden.
**Action:** When creating buttons in JS, explicitly set `aria-label` matching the visual tooltip/label. Always add `aria-hidden="true"` to the icon element to prevent confusing announcements.
## 2025-11-20 - [Dynamic UI Accessibility]
**Learning:** UI components generated dynamically via JavaScript (e.g., personality sliders, service buttons) often lacked the semantic structure (like `<input type="range">` or `aria-label`) present in their static HTML counterparts, leading to hidden accessibility failures.
**Action:** When porting or generating UI in JS, rigorously replicate the accessible HTML structure used in static templates, especially for custom controls like sliders.

## 2025-02-18 - [Custom Input Interaction]
**Learning:** Custom visual inputs (like sliders built with divs) that overlay native `sr-only` inputs must explicitly transfer focus to the native input on click. Without this, mouse users who click to set a value cannot immediately use keyboard controls (like arrow keys) for fine adjustments, breaking the expected interaction model.
**Action:** Always add `input.focus()` to the `mousedown` or `click` handler of custom visual controls that proxy to a hidden native input.
